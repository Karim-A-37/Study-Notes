## Linux Files and Paths

Linux treats everything as files with its famous rule: **"everything is a file"**.  
So a file is a file and also a directory is treated as a file, that is impressive and very different than other OSs.  

We can use two different types of paths:

- **Relative path** → is the short path. Like I am in root and I want to open `Downloads`, I can easily write `cd Downloads`.  
  In other words, relative path is dependent on your current directory.  
- **Absolute path** → is the full path from its root. It should start with `/` because it is root of every file.  
  Like if I am in root and I want to open `Downloads`, I can write `cd /root/Downloads`.  

In standard Linux file systems (ext4), the path name of a file, including all `/` characters, may be no more than **4095 bytes** (it is actually 4096 but one byte is reserved for the null terminator).  
Each component of the path name separated by `/` may be no more than **255 bytes** long.  

Linux uses a **tree hierarchy system** to sort or deal with its files.  
- Levels: lower levels start at `0` → `/` and higher levels for other things.  
- The absolute path should start from level `0` until reaching the desired path.  

### Special Usage

1. `~` → pointer for home directory of user  
2. `.` → pointer for current directory  
3. `..` → pointer of higher directory or previous one in path (like back button)  
4. `*` → wildcard for any characters after or before (e.g., `ls a*`)  
5. `?` → wildcard matching one character (e.g., `ls ?`)  
6. `[ ]` → character class (e.g., `ls [ac]` lists files named `a` or `c`; `[!ac]` or `[^ac]` lists files not `a` or `c`)  
7. `$` → used for command substitution (`echo $(date)`), variable substitution (`x=5; echo $x`), or arithmetic substitution (`echo $[1+2]` or `echo $((1+2))`)

## File Commands

1. `cd` → to change directory (`cd ~user` to go to home, `cd -` to go to previous directory)  
2. `dir` → list directory like `ls` but without color; add `--color` for colored output  
3. `ls -R` → list directories and their internal content  
4. `ls -r` → list in reverse alphabetical order  
5. `touch` → create file(s); overwrites timestamp if exists; use `"name"` or `'name'` or `name\ rest` for spaces  
6. `mkdir` → create directories (similar to touch for naming)  
7. `cp` → copy files or directories; destination must be a directory if copying multiple files  
8. `rm` → remove file or directory  
   - `-d` → remove directory  
   - `-f` → force (disable interactive prompt)  
   - `-r` → remove non-empty directories  
9. `nautilus` → open GUI file explorer  
10. `echo` → print something in terminal

## Linux Hierarchical File System

1. `/` → root or top directory which holds all Linux files  
2. `/boot` → files to start boot process  
3. `/dev` → special device files to access hardware  
4. `/etc` → system configuration files  
5. `/home` → home directory for normal users  
6. `/root` → home directory for root  
7. `/run` → run-time data for processes started from last boot  
8. `/tmp` → world-writable temporary space (files ignored for 10 days are deleted)  
9. `/usr` → user-installed software, libraries, documentation shared across system  
10. `/lib` → essential shared libraries and kernel modules needed to boot  
11. `/bin` → user command binaries  
12. `/sbin` → root-only command binaries  
13. `/var` → variable data that changes during system runtime (logs, `/var/tmp` deleted after 30 days if ignored)
