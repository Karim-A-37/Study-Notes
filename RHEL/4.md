## Standard Input, Output, and Error

- **Standard output (`>` )** → redirect output of command into file  
- **Standard output (`>>`)** → append output of command into file  
- **Standard input (`<`)** → redirect input from file into command (e.g., `cat < file.txt`)  
- **Standard error (`2>`)** → redirect command errors into file  
- **Both output and error (`&>`)** → redirect both into one file  
- **Append both output and error (`>> filename 2>&1`)** → append output and error  

### Pipelining (`|`)

- Take output of one command and give it as input to another (like a pipe).  

### Commands with Pipelining and Output

1. `less` → show content of file page by page, use space to navigate  
2. `more` → similar to less, but prints content to terminal after finishing pages  
3. `mail` → send email  
4. `tee` → save output of a pipeline into a file, can be used in another pipeline
