## Linux Help Commands

There is a rule in Linux: **don't remember everything and use help**.  
I agree with it because we are humans and we can't remember everything we want.  

The `--help` option is useful but displays summarized usage.  
For more detailed help, we have the **magic commands**:

1. `man` → displays manual pages for any command, detailed information  
2. `info` → displays manual pages with more detailed information  
3. `pinfo` → displays manual pages like `man` but in color  
4. `--help` → displays short usage of a command  
5. `man -k` or `apropos` → search for any word in all manual pages  
6. `man man` → shows how to use `man` command and its different chapters  

For documentation we can use [RedHat DOCS](https://docs.redhat.com).  
For help we can use [TDLP Blog](http://tldp.org/).  
For asking anything, we can use the Ubuntu community: [Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/).
