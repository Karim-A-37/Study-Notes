There is a rule in Linux says don't remember everything and use help, I agree with it because we are humans we can't remember everything we want so help commands is the most useful commands, I have said before that the option --help is the harry potter magic stick for anyone uses Linux, but it has one problems it displays usages shortly or summarized, so we need another one that displays with more information or detailed here is the magic itself it is called (man) command.
	1- man  -->> displays manual pages for any command, detailed information.
	2- info  -->> displays manual pages but more detailed information.
	3- pinfo  -->> displays manual pages like man but it is colored.
	4- --help  -->> displays shortly usages of command.
	5- man -k == apropos -->> to search for any word or words in all manual pages.
	6- man man -->> to show how to use man command and its different chapters.
